## Problem Statement 

This project predicts the image whether it is Apple or Kiwi or Mango or orange. 


## Tech Stack

- pandas
- tensorflow
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- cv2
- imghdr

## Data Source

Data Source Link : - 

[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samithsachidanandan/image-classification-cnn-fruits-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samithsachidanandan/image-classification-cnn-fruits-dataset)

- Data contains the Images of Apple, Kiwi, Mango and orange from Google.

## Limitation and what can be improved

This is just a small project to demonstrate the image classification. Project can be built to an app using streamlit or Flask where by providing the image we can ask the app to predict the image. 


## Run Locally
Initialize git

```bash
git init
```

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samithcsachi/Image_Classification_CNN_Fruits.git
```

Open Anaconda Prompt and Change the Directory 

```bash
cd E:/Image_Classification_CNN_Fruits

```

Activate the Virtual Environment 

```bash
py -3.11 -m venv imageclassification
```
Activate the venv environment

```bash
.\imageclassification\Scripts\activate
```

Install pykernel

```bash
pip install pykernel
```

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --name=imageclassification
```

Open the code in Jupyter Lab and select the kernel imageclassification and run the Jupyter notebook.
